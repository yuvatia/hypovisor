### Hypovisor

*Hypovisor* is a VT-x-based hypervisor, based heavily on [Sina Karvandi's](https://github.com/SinaKarvandi) ["Hypervisor From Scratch"](https://github.com/SinaKarvandi/Hypervisor-From-Scratch), using a vast majority of code from that project. It is also somewhat based on [Alex Ionescu's](https://github.com/ionescu007) [SimpleVisor](https://github.com/ionescu007/SimpleVisor), borrowing most of the EPT support logic from there as the "Hypervisor From Scratch" tutorials still haven't reached that part at the time of creating this repository.

This is a purely educational project, mainly made for me to mess around with Intel VT-x and follow along Sina's "Hypervisor from Scratch" tutorial series.
